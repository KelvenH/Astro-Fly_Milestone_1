                <p class="LEDstnd">Many astronauts have remarked that one experience more incredible
                    than looking out into space is to look down on our own home planet. From being so
                    far from ground you’ll gain an appreciation of how small our world is. Being able to
                    see the planet in a single view will take your breath away; from the snow capped
                    tips of the poles, deepest of blues of our oceans, the lush green landscapes and
                    yellow scorched sands of the hottest deserts overlaid with the ever changing swirls
                    created by the global jet streams – the colours of which are amplified against the
                    backdrop of deep dark space. each flight is guaranteed to provide two orbits of the
                    Earth. The pre-determined trajectory path crosses the globe in a seemingly diagonal
                    pattern ensuring visibility across all continents – passing over Earth’s equator
                    up-to 4 times! Every flight also includes ‘Astro:Zero’ a unique opportunity to
                    unshackle the harness and experience zero gravity. During this time you’ll be free
                    to choose how you wish to mark the moment, whether that’s participating with the
                    on-board Astro:Science team’s latest research, part-taking in a game of Zero:Ball or
                    simply living out a child hood dream of ‘flying’. The onboard meal served at this
                    time is also sure to become the most memorable meal of your life!

                    radiation waves from far flung galaxies, sending (and listening for a reply!) to

                <p class="LEDstnd">
                    Astro:Corp plans for manned flights to Mars are long established. The first of a
                    series of unmanned
                    flights have been in operation since early 2020. These initial flights have
                    served a
                    number of
                    purposes, from conducting sample tests on the environment, providing real time
                    weather reports and
                    conducting explorations in search of minerals, water or signs of microbial or
                    even
                    historic life.
                    But in addition to furthering our understanding of Mars, each flight has
                    successful
                    delivered
                    components of the Mars outpost (Camp Primus). Through a combination of
                    automation /
                    pre-programmed machinery and remote controlled robotics (principally operated
                    from
                    the team on Lunar
                    4 Base 5) a series of habitable domes have been constructed. Furthermore, flora
                    is
                    successfully
                    being
                    grown in oxygen sealed units. These have paved the way for the first of a series
                    of
                    our manned
                    flights which are on-track to depart Earth by late 2022. Whilst the first few
                    years
                    will be
                    exclusively dedicated to further our understanding of the red planet, plans are
                    on
