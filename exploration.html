                            is to look down on our own home planet. From being so far from ground you’ll gain an
                            appreciation of how small our world is. 
                            <br>

                            take your breath away; from the snow capped tips of the poles, deepest of blues of our
                            oceans, the lush green landscapes and yellow scorched sands of the hottest deserts overlaid
                            with the everchanging swirls created by the global jet streams – the colours of which are
                            amplified against the backdrop of deep dark space.

                            <p class="earth-txt2">Each flight is guaranteed to provide two orbits of the Earth. The pre-determined trajectory
                            path crosses the globe in a seemingly diagonal pattern ensuring visibility across all
                            continents – passing over Earth’s equator up-to 4 times!

                            Every flight also includes ‘Astro:Zero’ a unique opportunity to unshackle the harness and
                            experience zero gravity. During this time you’ll be free to choose how you wish to mark the
                            moment, whether that’s participating with the on-board Astro:Science team’s latest research,
                            part-taking in a game of Zero:Ball or simply living out a child hood dream of ‘flying’. The

                            scheduling), but this will seem too short as you immerse yourself with the deep space
                            experience. You’ll be invited to join the scientific team which will see you; observe our
                            planetary neighbours, measure radiation waves from far flung galaxies, sending (and
                            listening for a reply!) to your own voice beamed out beyond our solar system, determine the

                <br>
                <p>The future’s bright, the future’s Mars!

                    Astro:Corp plans for manned flights to Mars are long established. The first of a series of unmanned
                    flights have been in operation since early 2020. These initial flights have served a number of
                    purposes, from conducting sample tests on the environment, providing real time weather reports and
                    conducting explorations in search of minerals, water or signs of microbial or even historic life.
                    But in addition to furthering our understanding of Mars, each flight has successful delivered
                    components of the Mars outpost (Camp Primus). Through a combination of automation /
                    pre-programmed machinery and remote controlled robotics (principally operated from the team on Lunar
              4      Base 5) a series of habitable domes have been constructed. Furthermore, flora is successfully being
                    grown in oxygen sealed units. These have paved the way for the first of a series of our manned
                    flights which are on-track to depart Earth by late 2022. Whilst the first few years will be
                    exclusively dedicated to further our understanding of the red planet, plans are on schedule to
                    activate our Mars tourism route by 2025. Please register your interest here and you will be
                    contacted by one of the team.
