# Astro:Fly - Milestone Project 1
---
## Overview
Astro:Fly is a fictional company set to offer space tourism flights. In this scenario, the service is under development and a web site is being launched to garner public interest, provide information and register details of potential clientele. Any referrences to technologies are purely fictional and are not based on scientifc fact.  This project has been undertaken for educational purposes to demonstrate HTML and CSS essential skills (Code Institute Milestone Project 1).

### Personal Goals (Actual)
Through this project I am looking to; 
- Demonstrate understanding and application of HTML and CSS essential skills.
- Broaden personal awareness of further capabilities of HTML and CSS which go beyond those covered in module 1.
- Experience challenges, bugs, errors and frustrations through which problem solving will be a huge value-add / personal learn.
- Understand the limit of my current capabilities - looking to stretch myself without trying to achieve the impossible for a coding noob! 
- Serve as an example for a future portfolio of web site design and development which will also be used as an entry point which future projects can be assessed against to demonstrate improvements.
- The subject chosen for this project is to be fun, engaging but also on an area where broad range of dramatic / exaggerated design elements can be employed and have relevance - as opposed to a more traditional retail site where these would be out of place (e.g. use of transitional effects, fonts, color palette).
- Be proud of the final output!

### Business Goals (Fictional Scenario)
Astro:Fly require a site which;
- generates buzz and excitement to the general public and media
- conveys image of a safe and ethical brand (despite the slight irony the service could have on planet earth / airspace)
- provides prospective clients with summary of planned voyages tus leading to the registration of potential clientele

### Client Goals (Fictional Scenario)
Site visitors are expected to fall into 1 of 3 categories;
- media; the new service is expected to create attention due to this being an extreme niche service / limited rivals
- general public; seeking latest information on the planned service such as timelines, what services will be offered and images 
- prospective clients; to whet the appetite for client base who would need to have pockets as deep as their enthusiasm for deep space!

## UX

*Temporary sub headings & notes for 5 planes of UX to be consistently referred to - to be truncated to outcomes in final write-up*

Form should follow function- intuitive and simple to use delivers positive emotional experience

- Strategy - what am i aiming to achieve, goals, initial idea
- Scope - what's on the table for inclusion (or not)
- Structure - how is information structured and logically grouped
- Skeleton - how information will be presented / navigated
- Surface - what will the finished product look like; color palette, fonts, images and other design elements

### User Stories

### Links to wireframes

## Styles

### Color palette 

Opting for smart, sophisticated visual branding. Pre-build looking for primary colouring from group 1 and secondary / accent from group 2. 

Group | Considered | Selected | Notes |
------|-----------|----------| ------|
1|Metallic|TBD|May require use of external textures?
1|Black|TBD|
1|Grey|TBD|
2|UV (purple)|TBD|
2|Blue|TBD|
2|Orange|TBD|
2|Red|TBD|

### Site Theme

Considered | Selected| Notes|
-----------|---------|------|
Steampunk | No | Whilst preferred to style selected, expect this would require additional resources, time to incorporate which would detract from primary objectives for the project
Vintage (e.g. 70's prediction of future) | No | For same reasons as given above.
Futuristic | Yes | Expect these to be more easily available and achieved through basic shapes / easily available images |
